Logical Database Model vs Physical Database Model
================
Logical database modeling is primarily intended to gather information about business needs and does not involve database design; whereas physical database modeling is primarily required for the actual design of the database. the database.

Logical Database Model
=======
Logical database modeling is necessary to compile business requirements and represent the requirements as a model. It is primarily associated with collecting business requirements rather than designing the database. The information that needs to be collected is about organizational units, business entities and business processes.

Once the information is compiled, reports and diagrams are produced, including these:

ERD-entity relationship diagram the diagram shows the relationship between the different categories of data and presents the different categories of data required for the development of a database. Business Process Diagram-, It shows the activities of individuals within the business. It shows how data moves through the organization based on the application interface that can be designed. Documentation of user feedback.

Logical database models essentially determine if all the requirements of the business have been gathered. It is reviewed by the developers, management and finally the end users to see if more information needs to be gathered before physical modeling begins.

Physical Database Model 
=======
Physical database modeling deals with the design of the actual database based on the requirements gathered during logical database modeling. All the collected information is converted into relational and business models. During physical modeling, objects are defined at a level called schema level. A schema is considered to be a group of objects that are related to each other in a database. Tables and columns are made based on the information provided during logical modeling. Primary keys, unique keys and foreign keys are defined to provide constraints. Indexes and snapshots are defined. Data can be summarized, and users are given another perspective once tables have been created.

The modeling of the physical database depends on the software already used in the organization. It is software specific. Physical modeling includes:

Server model diagram-it includes tables and columns and different relationships that exist in a database. Database design documentation. User feedback documentation.
